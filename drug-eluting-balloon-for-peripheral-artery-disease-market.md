<p><h1>Global Drug Eluting Balloon for Peripheral Artery Disease Market Size and Market Trends: Insights and Projections from 2024 to 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Drug Eluting Balloon for Peripheral Artery Disease Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Drug Eluting Balloons (DEBs) are advanced medical devices used to treat Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD), a condition characterized by narrowed arteries leading to reduced blood flow to the limbs. DEBs are coated with therapeutic agents that are released during balloon angioplasty, helping to inhibit restenosis and promote healing by preventing the re-narrowing of the treated artery.</p><p>The Drug Eluting Balloon for Peripheral Artery Disease Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.4% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to increasing prevalence of PAD, advancements in balloon technology, and rising awareness about minimally invasive treatment options. Recent trends indicate a shift toward the use of DEBs over traditional bare-metal balloons due to their superior efficacy in reducing re-blockage rates.</p><p>Furthermore, there is a growing focus on patient-centric care, with DEBs offering faster recovery times and reduced hospital stays. Collaborations between manufacturers and healthcare providers to enhance clinical outcomes are also emerging. Continued innovation, including the development of next-generation DEBs with potent drug formulations, is likely to propel market growth, addressing the unmet needs of patients with PAD.</p></p>
