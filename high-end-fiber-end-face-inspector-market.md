<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High-end Fiber End-face Inspector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Contactless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The High-end Fiber End-face Inspector market is categorized into contact and contactless inspection types. Contact inspection involves directly touching the fiber end-face with the inspector's probe, allowing for precise measurements and analysis. This type is often used in environments where accuracy is paramount. In contrast, contactless inspection employs advanced imaging technologies, such as cameras and lasers, to assess fiber end-faces without physical contact. This method enhances convenience and reduces the risk of contamination, making it suitable for high-traffic or sensitive settings.</p></p>
