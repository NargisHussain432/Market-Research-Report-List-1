<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas-Fired Power Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CCGT</li><li>OCGT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural gas-fired power generation encompasses two primary market types: Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) and Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT). CCGT systems use both gas and steam turbines to achieve higher efficiency by capturing exhaust heat for additional power generation, making them ideal for baseload and peaking power. In contrast, OCGT systems operate gas turbines alone, offering quick start-up times and flexibility for peak demand or backup power. Both play vital roles in modern energy systems, balancing supply and demand efficiently.</p></p>
