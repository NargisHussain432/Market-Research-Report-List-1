<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lab-Grown Diamonds Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CVD Diamonds</li><li>HTHP Diamonds</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lab-grown diamonds primarily fall into two categories: CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) diamonds and HTHP (High-Pressure, High-Temperature) diamonds. CVD diamonds are created by depositing carbon gases in a controlled environment, leading to high-quality stones with unique characteristics. On the other hand, HTHP diamonds simulate natural diamond formation by applying intense heat and pressure to carbon. Both methods result in diamonds that are chemically identical to natural ones but are often more affordable and environmentally sustainable, appealing to a growing market.</p></p>
