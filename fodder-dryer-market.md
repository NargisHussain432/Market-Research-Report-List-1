<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fodder Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Heat Exchange</li><li>Indirect Heat Exchange</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fodder dryer market can be classified into two main types based on the heat exchange method: direct heat exchange and indirect heat exchange. Direct heat exchange dryers utilize direct contact between the hot air and fodder, allowing for rapid moisture removal, but may risk product quality due to potential thermal damage. In contrast, indirect heat exchange dryers use a separate heat source to heat air, ensuring gentler drying conditions, preserving nutritional content while achieving efficient moisture reduction.</p></p>
