<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dry Powder Inhaler Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capsule Based</li><li>Blister Based</li><li>Reservoir/Cartridge Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) are classified into three main types: capsule-based, blister-based, and reservoir/cartridge-based. Capsule-based inhalers require the patient to insert a capsule containing the medication, which is then pierced to release the powder for inhalation. Blister-based devices use pre-measured doses sealed in blisters that are punctured before use. Reservoir/cartridge-based inhalers store a bulk supply of medication and dispense it in measured doses with each actuation, providing convenience and efficiency for chronic respiratory conditions.</p></p>
