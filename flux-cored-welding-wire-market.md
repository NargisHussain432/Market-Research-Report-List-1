<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flux Cored Welding Wire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gas-shielded</li><li>Self-shielded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flux-cored welding wire is used in arc welding, offering high deposition rates and efficiency. It comes in two main types: gas-shielded and self-shielded. Gas-shielded flux-cored wires require external shielding gas (like CO2 or argon mix) to protect the weld pool from contamination, providing high-quality welds suitable for heavy-duty applications. Self-shielded wires contain flux compounds that generate their own shielding gas, making them portable and ideal for outdoor or windy conditions, though they may produce more spatter and require post-weld cleaning. Both types cater to diverse industrial needs.</p></p>
