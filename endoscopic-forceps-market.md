<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Endoscopic Forceps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopolar Endoscopic Forceps</li><li>Bipolar Endoscopic Forceps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The endoscopic forceps market is categorized into two primary types: monopolar and bipolar endoscopic forceps. Monopolar endoscopic forceps utilize a single electrode for cutting or coagulating tissue, relying on an external grounding pad to complete the circuit. In contrast, bipolar endoscopic forceps have two electrodes, allowing for more controlled energy delivery directly to the tissue, minimizing collateral damage. These devices are crucial in minimally invasive surgeries, providing surgeons with precise tools for tissue manipulation and surgical procedures.</p></p>
