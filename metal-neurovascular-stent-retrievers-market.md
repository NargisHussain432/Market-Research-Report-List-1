<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Neurovascular Stent Retrievers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Expanding Stents</li><li>Self-Expanding Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Metal neurovascular stent retrievers are medical devices used in the treatment of neurovascular conditions, particularly in the management of ischemic strokes. Balloon expanding stents are designed to be expanded using a balloon catheter, providing precise deployment and support for vessels. In contrast, self-expanding stents utilize inherent material properties to expand and conform to the vessel wall, offering a more passive solution. Both types aim to restore blood flow by keeping vessels open, thereby improving patient outcomes.</p></p>
