<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arterial Vascular Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self Expansion</li><li>Balloon Dilatation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The arterial vascular stents market comprises two primary types: self-expanding stents and balloon dilatation stents. Self-expanding stents are designed to automatically expand upon deployment, offering a reliable support structure for narrowed arteries. In contrast, balloon dilatation stents require a balloon catheter to be inflated, forcing the stent into position to restore blood flow. Each type serves specific needs in vascular treatments, targeting conditions such as atherosclerosis, and improving patient outcomes through enhanced blood circulation.</p></p>
