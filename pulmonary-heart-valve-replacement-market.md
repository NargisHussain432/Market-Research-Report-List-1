<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pulmonary Heart Valve Replacement Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Heart Surgery</li><li>Minimally Invasive Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pulmonary Heart Valve Replacement market encompasses two main surgical approaches: open heart surgery and minimally invasive surgery. Open heart surgery involves a large incision to access the heart, allowing for direct replacement of the damaged valve but requiring extended recovery. In contrast, minimally invasive surgery utilizes smaller incisions and robotic-assisted technologies, aiming to reduce recovery time and minimize trauma to surrounding tissues. Both approaches cater to varying patient needs and preferences in treating pulmonary valve disorders.</p></p>
