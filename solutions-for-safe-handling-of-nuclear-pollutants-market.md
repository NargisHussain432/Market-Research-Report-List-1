<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solutions for Safe Handling of Nuclear Pollutants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Level Waste</li><li>Medium Level Waste</li><li>High Level Waste</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The safe handling of nuclear pollutants involves categorizing waste into three main types: low-level waste (LLW), medium-level waste (MLW), and high-level waste (HLW). LLW, often from medical or industrial sources, requires minimal shielding and can be disposed of in near-surface facilities. MLW, emanating from nuclear reactors and research, demands more robust containment and storage. HLW, primarily from spent fuel, necessitates deep geological repositories due to its high radioactivity and heat generation, ensuring long-term safety and environmental protection.</p></p>
