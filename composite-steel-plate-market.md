<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Steel Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Explosion Bonded</li><li>Roll Bonded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The composite steel plate market includes two primary types: explosion bonded and roll bonded plates. Explosion bonded plates are created by using explosive energy to fuse two dissimilar metals, resulting in a strong, metallurgically bonded composite. This method is ideal for applications requiring high strength and resistance to harsh environments. In contrast, roll bonded plates employ a mechanical process where two metals are passed through rollers under high pressure, ensuring good adhesion. This technique is often used for lighter applications due to its efficiency and cost-effectiveness.</p></p>
